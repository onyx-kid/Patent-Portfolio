### Patent Contributions Showcase

This repository is intended to **document and highlight my contributions as a co-inventor / inventor** to one or more granted or filed patents.  
It serves as a reference for my involvement in specific research and development efforts that have led to patented innovations.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a patent where I have contributed to certain components.
